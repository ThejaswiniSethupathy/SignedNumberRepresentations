Sign-Magnitude Representation

This is the simplest method. Here, the most significant bit (MSB) indicates the sign:

0 means positive

1 means negative

The rest of the bits represent the number’s magnitude (absolute value).

Example (4-bit):

+5 = 0101

-5 = 1101

Key points:

The range is roughly from –(2ⁿ⁻¹–1) to +(2ⁿ⁻¹–1).

It has two zeros: 0000 (+0) and 1000 (–0), which can complicate calculations.
