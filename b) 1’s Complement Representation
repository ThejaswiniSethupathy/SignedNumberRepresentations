This improves on sign-magnitude by making negation easier:

The MSB is still the sign bit.

To get the negative of a number, you flip all the bits of its positive form (called taking the 1’s complement).

Example (4-bit):

+5 = 0101

-5 = 1010 (1’s complement of 0101)

Key points:

Similar range as sign-magnitude.

Still has two zeros: 0000 and 1111.

Addition requires a special "end-around carry" step.
