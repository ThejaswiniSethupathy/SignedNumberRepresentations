1) Unique Zero Representation
Unlike the other schemes, 2’s complement has just one zero (0000). This avoids confusion and makes comparison logic simpler.

2) Simpler Arithmetic Operations
You can add and subtract positive and negative numbers directly without extra steps to handle signs. The hardware adder just adds bits normally, no sign checks or special cases needed.

3) No End-Around Carry
1’s complement requires an extra step to add the carry back into the least significant bit, which complicates hardware. 2’s complement doesn’t need this.

4) Easy Overflow Detection
Detecting overflow in 2’s complement is straightforward — simply compare carry bits or signs of operands and results.

5) Efficient Hardware Implementation
All these benefits make 2’s complement circuits faster, simpler, and use fewer gates.
