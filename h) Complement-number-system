Complement systems make subtraction easier across different bases by turning subtraction into addition:

Binary: 1’s and 2’s complement (flipping bits, adding 1).

Decimal: 9’s and 10’s complement (subtract digits from 9, then add 1).

Octal: 7’s and 8’s complement.

Hexadecimal: F’s and 16’s complement (same concept, subtract from F and add 1).


EXAMPLES
  
9’s and 10’s Complement - decimal

9’s Complement

Subtract each digit from 9.

Example Number: 254

9’s complement = 999 − 254 = 745

10’s Complement

Step 1: Take 9’s complement

Step 2: Add 1

Example:

9’s complement of 254 = 745

Add 1: 746 → This is −254 in 10’s complement


7’s and 8’s Complement - octal

7’s Complement

Subtract each digit from 7 

Example Number: 325 (octal)

7’s complement = 452 

8’s Complement

Step 1: Take 7’s complement

Step 2: Add 1

Example:

7’s complement of 325 = 452

Add 1: 453 → This is −325 (in 8’s complement octal form)


F’s Complement - hex

Subtract each digit from F (15 in decimal)

Example Number: 2A

F’s complement: D5 

16’s Complement (2’s Complement in Hex)

Step 1: Take F’s complement

Step 2: Add 1

Example:

F’s complement of 2A = D5

Add 1 = D6 → This is −2A in 16’s complement (Hex)
