Steps for Sign-Magnitude Scheme

1) Represent both numbers in sign-magnitude form.

2) Check signs:

If same sign → add magnitudes.

If different signs → subtract the smaller magnitude from the larger one.

3) Assign result sign:

Same sign inputs → use that sign.

Different signs → use the sign of the number with larger magnitude.

4) Combine sign and magnitude for the final result.


EXAMPLE 1: 

Add +5 and +3

Step 1: Represent numbers
+5 → 0 101 (sign=0, magnitude=101)
+3 → 0 011

Step 2: Since signs are the same, add magnitudes:
101 + 011 = 1000 (which is 8)

Step 3: Result sign = 0 (positive)

Step 4: Final result = 0 1000 → +8


EXAMPLE 2:

Add +5 and –3

Step 1: Represent numbers
+5 → 0 101
–3 → 1 011

Step 2: Signs differ, so subtract magnitudes:
5 - 3 = 2

Step 3: Result sign = sign of larger magnitude (which is +5, so sign=0)

Step 4: Final result = 0 010 → +2
