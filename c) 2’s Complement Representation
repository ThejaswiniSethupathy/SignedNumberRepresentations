This is the common method in most modern systems because it simplifies arithmetic:

The MSB is the sign bit.

To get the negative of a number, take the 1’s complement and add 1.

Example (4-bit):

+5 = 0101

-5 = 1011 (1’s complement of 0101 is 1010 + 1 = 1011)

Key points:

Range extends from –2ⁿ⁻¹ to +(2ⁿ⁻¹–1).

Only one zero representation (0000), which simplifies logic.

Addition and subtraction are straightforward using standard binary addition hardware.
